In this important book, he focuses not so much on what has happened or why, but on what to do about it, particularly in the UK. The result is a challenging set of proposals.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-courage-to-act-a-memoir-of-the-crisis-and-its-aftermath-by-ben-bernanke class=review__heading>The Courage to Act</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Ben Bernanke</p><div class=review__body><p>Bernanke was at the helm of the world’s most important central bank during the financial crisis of 2007-08. A distinguished scholar of the Great Depression, he was the right man to be in charge of US monetary policy at that time. Here he gives a compelling account of what he and the Federal Reserve did and why they did it. The book also provides reflections on the lessons. He is insufficiently radical on finance. But his defence of the Fed against its critics is compelling.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-globalization-of-inequality-by-francois-bourguignon-translated-by-thomas-scott-railton class=review__heading>The Globalization of Inequality</h3><p class=review__subheading>by François Bourguignon (Translated by Thomas Scott-Railton)</p><div class=review__body><p>Bourguignon’s focus is global, not local, and is more on what has happened to inequality than on what to do about it. This makes it a valuable complement to Atkinson’s book. Crucially, Bourguignon points to some good news: inequality has been falling among households at a global level, albeit from extremely high levels, and there have been impressive reductions in the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-public-wealth-of-nations-by-dag-detter-and-stefan-foelster class=review__heading>The Public Wealth of Nations</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster</p><div class=review__body><p>The public sector balance sheet does not only have liabilities.

Rauchway argues that misguided fear of inflation prevented adoption of the fiscal and monetary stimulus needed to secure a rapid recovery from the Great Recession. Unfortunately, he says, the success in saving the banks in the autumn of 2008 reduced the political urgency of saving the economy. Today’s unhappy result is feeble economies and barelyreformed financial systems.

Rodrik, one of the world’s most perceptive policy analysts, wants it let out again, albeit on a leash. One should, he insists, regard economics as “a collection of models”, not as a single grand, overarching theory. The economist’s art lies in knowing which model is appropriate to the task at hand.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-age-of-sustainable-development-by-jeffrey-sachs class=review__heading>The Age of Sustainable Development</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Jeffrey Sachs</p><div class=review__body><p>Sachs is a prophet calling upon humanity to create a better world. This would, he argues, have two main characteristics: we would have largely banished the scourges of destitution and disease; and we would have made the activities upon which humanity depends indefinitely sustainable. In Sachs’s view, both of these goals are now eminently attainable — but we are “far off course”.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=europe-s-orphan-the-future-of-the-euro-and-the-politics-of-debt-by-martin-sandbu class=review__heading>Europe&#39;s Orphan</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Martin Sandbu</p><div class=review__body><p>My FT colleague, Martin Sandbu, seeks to rescue the euro from obloquy. His argument is that it is not the euro but mistaken policy that has caused the crisis of the eurozone. Monetary union does not need fiscal and political union. It needs debt restructuring. The book provides a sophisticated “liquidationist” alternative to the dominant rhetoric.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=why-are-we-waiting-the-logic-urgency-and-primise-of-tackling-climate-change-by-nicholas-stern class=review__heading>Why are We Waiting?</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Nicholas Stern</p><div class=review__body><p>Lord Stern was author of the 2007 <em>Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change</em>. In this follow-up, he argues strongly that we are continuing to underestimate the costs of inaction. It is time to act, he asserts, not only because the costs of failing to do so could be huge, but also because the costs of the needed actions are becoming ever smaller.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=misbehaving-the-making-of-behavioural-economics-by-richard-thaler class=review__heading>Misbehaving</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Richard Thaler</p><div class=review__body><p>This enjoyable book describes the role of the author in the making of an intellectual counter-revolution: the rise of “behavioural economics”. Not so long ago, right-thinking economists focused their attention on an imaginary species of sociopaths, rational maximisers whom Thaler calls “Econs”. Actual people, however, whom he calls “Humans”, are vastly more interesting. Thaler explains how much we have learnt about the mistakes we humans are apt to make.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=between-debt-and-the-devil-money-credit-and-fixing-global-finance-by-adair-turner class=review__heading>Between Debt and the Devil</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Adair Turner</p><div class=review__body><p>Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, provides a brilliant analysis of the fragility of our debt-fuelled economies. History has shown that the confidence in the benefits of financial liberalisation and the stability offered by inflation-targeting was a “fatal conceit”. Hayek had applied this phrase to socialist planning. But uncritical belief in the free market rested on essentially the same mistaken utopianism.</p></div></div><div class="card card--image"><img src=../images/covers/betweendebtandthedevil.jpg alt="Books cover: Between Debt and the Devil"></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=climate-shock-the-economic-consequences-of-a-hotter-planet-by-gernot-wagner-and-martin-weitzman class=review__heading>Climate Shock</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman</p><div class=review__body><p>We insure our lives against an uncertain future; so why not our planet? That is the question addressed in this lively and thought-provoking book. The authors show that among the possible outcomes of the path we are on are extreme climate changes. Rational and far-sighted policymakers would wish to eliminate such possibilities. Yet if we are to achieve that goal, we need to act now.</p></div></div><div class="card card--image"><img src=../images/covers/climateshock.jpg alt="Books cover: Climate Shock"></div></li></ul></section><style>

But Ip explains this paradox through entertaining and provocative parallels with the worlds of civil aviation, flood management and forestry. Sometimes, he points out, it is better to allow a small fire to burn than to extinguish it and risk a bigger conflagration.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-second-curve-thoughts-on-reinventing-society-by-charles-handy class=review__heading>The Second Curve</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Charles Handy</p><div class=review__body><p>Now in his eighties, management thinker Handy continues to probe and provoke with a series of revolutionary suggestions about how individuals and institutions should take a leap and renew themselves before their “first curve” of development dips.
