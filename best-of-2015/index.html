In this important book, he focuses not so much on what has happened or why, but on what to do about it, particularly in his own country, the UK. The result is a comprehensive and challenging set of proposals for action, including substantially higher taxation and greater redistribution of wealth. The Labour party, currently bereft of confidence and ideas, needs to study what Atkinson recommends.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-courage-to-act-a-memoir-of-the-crisis-and-its-aftermath-by-ben-bernanke class=review__heading>The Courage to Act</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Ben Bernanke</p><div class=review__body><p>Ben Bernanke was in charge of the world’s most important central bank during the world’s biggest financial crisis for almost 80 years. A distinguished scholar of the Great Depression, Bernanke was the right man to be in charge of US monetary policy at that time. In this book, he gives a compelling account of what he and the Federal Reserve did and why they did it. The book also provides reflections on the lessons. He is insufficiently radical on finance. But his defence of the Fed against its misguided critics is compelling.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=null-by-francois-bourguignon-translated-by-thomas-scott-railton class=review__heading>The Globalization of Inequality</h3><p class=review__subheading>by François Bourguignon (Translated by Thomas Scott-Railton)</p><div class=review__body><p>Bourguignon’s focus is global, not local, and is more on what has happened to inequality than on what to do about it. This makes it a valuable complement to Atkinson’s book. Crucially, Bourguignon points to some good news: inequality has been falling among households at a global level, albeit from extremely high levels, and there have been impressive reductions in the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=null-by-dag-detter-and-stefan-foelster class=review__heading>The Public Wealth of Nations</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster</p><div class=review__body><p>The public sector balance sheet does not only have liabilities. It also has assets. Managing those assets well is at least as important as managing the liabilities. In this important book, the authors show how big, undervalued and mismanaged public assets general are. Using those assets more productively is vital for both the state and the wider society. This does not always require privatisation. But it does require a sober look at how to get the best possible social return.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-rise-of-the-robots-technology-and-the-threat-of-a-jobless-future-by-martin-ford class=review__heading>The Rise of the Robots</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Martin Ford</p><div class=review__body></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=other-people-s-money-masters-of-the-universe-or-servants-of-the-people-by-john-kay class=review__heading>Other People&#39;s Money</h3><p class=review__subheading>by John Kay</p><div class=review__body><p>“The finance sector of modern Western economies is too large. . . Its growth has not been matched by corresponding improvements in the provision of services to the non-financial economy.” In this excellent book, John Kay, a fellow columnist on the FT, explains how this came about and what to do about it. The most important conclusions are that the financial sector must be made smaller and simpler. It must become a servant of the economy, not its greedy master.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-money-makers-how-roosevelet-and-keynes-ended-the-depression-defeated-fascism-and-secured-a-prosperous-peace-by-eric-rauchway class=review__heading>The Money Makers</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Eric Rauchway</p><div class=review__body><p>Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. Eric Rauchway argues that misguided fear of inflation prevented adoption of the fiscal and monetary stimulus needed to secure a rapid recovery from the Great Recession. Unfortunately, he argues, the success in saving the banks in the autumn of 2008 reduced the political urgency of saving the economy. Today’s unhappy result is feeble economies and barely-reformed financial systems. We have, alas, forgotten what Roosevelt and Keynes knew.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=economics-rules-the-rights-and-wrongs-of-the-dismal-science-by-dani-rodrik class=review__heading>Economics Rules</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Dani Rodrik</p><div class=review__body><p>After the financial crisis, economics is in the doghouse. Dani Rodrik, one of the world’s most perceptive policy analysts, wants it let out again, albeit on a leash. “Economists who remain true to their discipline. . . are necessarily humble,” argues Rodrik. One should, he insists, regard economics as “a collection of models”, not as a single grand, overarching theory. The economist’s art lies in knowing which model is appropriate to the task at hand.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=null-by-jeffrey-sachs class=review__heading>The Age of Sustainable Development</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Jeffrey Sachs</p><div class=review__body><p>Sachs is a prophet calling upon humanity to create a better world. This would, he argues, have two main characteristics: we would have largely banished the scourges of destitution and disease; and we would have made the activities upon which humanity depends indefinitely sustainable. In Sachs’s view, both of these goals are now eminently attainable — but we are “far off course”.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=europe-s-orphan-the-future-of-the-euro-and-the-politics-of-debt-by-martin-sandbu class=review__heading>Europe&#39;s Orphan</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Martin Sandbu</p><div class=review__body><p>My FT colleague, Martin Sandbu, seeks to rescue the euro from obloquy. His argument is that it is not the euro but mistaken policy that has caused the economic and political crisis of the eurozone. Monetary union does not need fiscal and political union. It needs debt restructuring. The book provides a sophisticated “liquidationist” alternative to the dominant rhetoric, which insists that the only alternatives are further integration or dissolution. One might not be convinced. But this book provides an invaluable riposte to conventional wisdom.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=why-are-we-waiting-the-logic-urgency-and-primise-of-tackling-climate-change-by-nicholas-stern class=review__heading>Why are We Waiting?</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Nicholas Stern</p><div class=review__body><p>Lord Stern was author of the eponymous <em>Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change</em> published in 2007. In this follow-up, he argues strongly that we are continuing to underestimate the potential costs of inaction. It is time to take decisive action, he asserts, not only because the costs of failing to do so could be huge, but also because the costs of the needed actions are themselves becoming ever smaller.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=misbehaving-the-making-of-behavioural-economics-by-richard-thaler class=review__heading>Misbehaving</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Richard Thaler</p><div class=review__body><p>This enjoyable book describes the role of the author in the making of an intellectual counter-revolution: the rise of “behavioural economics”. Not so long ago, right-thinking economists focused their attention on an imaginary species of sociopaths, rational maximisers whom Thaler calls “Econs”. Actual people, however, whom he calls “Humans”, are vastly more interesting. Humans make predictable errors. Thaler explains how much we have learnt about the mistakes we humans are apt to make.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=between-debt-and-the-devil-money-credit-and-fixing-global-finance-by-adair-turner class=review__heading>Between Debt and the Devil</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Adair Turner</p><div class=review__body><p>Adair Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, provides a brilliant analysis of the fragility of our debt-fuelled economies. History has shown that the confidence in the benefits of financial liberalisation and the stability offered by inflation-targeting was a “fatal conceit”. Friedrich Hayek had applied this phrase to socialist planning. But belief in the free market rested on essentially the same mistake. Both ways of thinking are utopian and, as such, fundamentally mistaken.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=climate-shock-the-economic-consequences-of-a-hotter-planet-by-gernot-wagner-and-martin-weitzman class=review__heading>Climate Shock</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman</p><div class=review__body><p>We insure our lives against an uncertain future; so why not our planet? That is the question addressed in this lively and thought-provoking book. The challenge of climate change should be seen as one of managing an inherently uncertain future. The authors show that among the possible outcomes of the path we are on are extreme climate changes. Rational and far-sighted policymakers would wish to eliminate such possibilities. Yet if we are to achieve that goal, we need to act now. Only the extremely myopic would behave as if a distant and potentially catastrophic risk were a non-existent one.</p></div></div><div class="card card--image"><img src=../images/climate-shock.jpg></div></li></ul></section><section class=section><header id=business-books class=section__header><h2 class=section__title>Business</h2><p class=section__subtitle>Andrew Hill</p></header><ul><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-rise-of-the-robots-technology-and-the-threat-of-a-jobless-future-by-martin-ford class=review__heading>The Rise of the Robots</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Martin Ford</p><div class=review__body><p>Ford’s chilling message in <em>The Rise of the Robots</em> – winner of this year’s Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award – is that the transition to a less labour-intensive economy will be miserable and even dangerous as inequality, technological unemployment and climate change collide.

But Ip explains this compelling paradox through entertaining and provocative parallels with the worlds of civil aviation, flood management and forestry. Sometimes, he points out, it is better to allow a small fire to burn than to extinguish it and risk a bigger conflagration.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=the-second-curve-thoughts-on-reinventing-society-by-charles-handy class=review__heading>The Second Curve</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Charles Handy</p><div class=review__body><p>Now in his eighties, management thinker Handy continues to probe and provoke with a series of revolutionary suggestions about how individuals and institutions should take a leap and renew themselves before their “first curve” of development dips downwards. The simplicity of his prose belies the sheer ambition of some of the ideas for reform – dismantle multinationals, redesign the UK Parliament – each of which could merit a book in itself.</p></div></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=losing-the-signal-the-untold-story-behind-the-extraordinary-rise-and-spectacular-fall-of-blackberry-by-jacquie-mcnish-and-sean-silcoff class=review__heading>Losing the Signal</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff</p><div class=review__body><p>The tale of how a talented engineer and an ambitious salesman created the signature business communications device of the early 2000s is ably told by McNish and Silcoff.

Ranging widely from the latest research to her personal struggle to negotiate the obstacle course of academia and public policy, Slaughter points out that the problem is not, <em>pace</em> Sandberg, with women, but with work. Specifically, employers, engrained leadership habits and policies need to change in order to allow women to advance freely.</p></div></div><div class="card card--image"><img src=../images/bells.png></div></li><li class=review><div class=card><h3 id=digital-gold-the-untold-story-of-bitcoin-by-nathaniel-popper class=review__heading>Digital Gold</h3><p class=review__subheading>by Nathaniel Popper</p><div class=review__body><p>This timely first draft of the history of a new crypto-currency provides as reliable a guide to the rise of bitcoin as is possible, given the anarchy surrounding its creation, its volatile evolution and unpredictable future.
